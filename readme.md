Rules: 
Try to guess the secret code. The code has 4 colors in a row.
After each guess 4 pegs are filled according to how close your guess
was to the secret code. For every color that is in the correct place a 
peg is colored black. For every correct color but incorrect placement
a peg is colored red. Use deduction to solve the secret code.
